1 - Open Sumo - Infor SumoLogic URL: https://login.infor.com/sumo
2 - Paste in query above, starting with line beginning with: //
3 - Click on Magnifier in top right, and then Custom tab
4 - if one day just double click the day end enter hour range in military hours: 14 for 2PM for example in the starting and ending hour then click apply
	if the dates cross days, double-click on the first day entering military hour, click the first day, then the 2nd day, then enter military hour for end day
	AND make sure to click APPLY
5 - On the top of the query, comment unneeded region with //, and change the sourcehost provided by cloud ops
6 - Run the query by clicking magnifying glass in the top right
7 - Once you see results on the Aggregates tab see if one customer db stands out, if so you can filter by obvious one and run again
8 - Once you see results a second time look at the Messages and see as you scroll through messages if there is a predominant Blocking Session ID
9 - Comment out line like: // | where !(isNull(blocking_session_id)) and uncomment line like: | where blocking_session_id = 1522
	changing the spid above from 1522 to your common blocking session
10 - Run the query again, scrolling through the messages, expanding the ... buttons to see session_id, blocking_session_id to see if the session is lead blocker
	or if you have blocking session ID, or wait time it is not the lead block
11 -  Record the spid, collection time, host, spid, sql query
